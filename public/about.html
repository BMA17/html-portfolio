<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Banashree, a digital marketer by profession, and I'm thrilled to explore the world of front-end development. 
  My true passion lies in crafting vibrant websites that offer seamless user experiences.</p>

<p>As a jack-of-all-trades, I possess a wide range of skills, including SEO and email marketing. 
  However, creating websites using low-code no-code tools is my favorite. 
  I find immense joy in building something that needs to be shared and bringing it to life in a way that captivates people's attention.</p>

  <p>As I navigate this career transition, I believe it's essential to showcase my knowledge and experience with the world. 
    Therefore, I invite you to explore my portfolio on GitHub, where you can find all my work.</p>
